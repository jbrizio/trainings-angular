## Index

- Angular CLI
- TypeScript
- Node.js
- npm

## [Set up the Development Environment](https://angular.io/guide/quickstart#devenv)
You need to set up your development environment before you can do anything. Install Node.js and npm if they are not already on your machine. Then install the Angular CLI globally.

`
npm install -g @angular/cli
`
## [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)
Angular CLI ( Command Line Interface) is a tool that makes it easy to start new projects, generate components, routes, services, serve your projects and run tests.

## [TypeScript](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, meaning that it contains all of the functionality of JavaScript and then some. Therefore, any program written in valid JavaScript will also run as expected in TypeScript. In fact, TypeScript compiles simply too plain JavaScript. So, whatâ€™s the difference? TypeScript offers us more control over our code via type annotations, interfaces, and classes.

## [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/es/)
 It's an open source, a cross-platform runtime environment for developing server-side. Node.js also provides a rich library of various JavaScript modules which simplifies the development of web applications.

 ## [npm](https://www.npmjs.com)
npm is a package manager. The main goal, as you name says, is an automated dependency and package management. This means that you can specify all of your project's dependencies inside your package.json file.
